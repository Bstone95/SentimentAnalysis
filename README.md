# SentimentAnalysis at Lamar University
Sentiment Analysis utilizing a Large Language Model provided by HuggingFace Worked with Python to pull data from Reddit, create pipeline, and run the LLM. Data was stored in CSV files where LLM would obtain comments and apply Sentiment Analysis.  I worked with pre-trained models and compared them to self-treained models to understand consistency in relevant data and how mentalhealth is currently being influenced by post-Covid internet activity.  This was done as a Research Internship in works with Lamar University

The Model Bert file tests to ensure the LLM is working properly with a small sample size of data.

The Trained model will utilize data you have pulled and create a self-trained LLM capable of Senitment Analysis.

The PreTrained model will utilize the large amount of parameters provided by HuggingFace to create a Sentiment Analysis model.
